# Project: Sunrise Animation Under Mountain

This project simulates a rising sun under a mountain when the user hovers over the page. It uses pure HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript, to achieve a smooth transition from night to day.

---

### Features:
- **Night to Day Transition**: Upon hovering, the background changes from a night-time scene with a moon and stars to a daytime scene with a rising sun and clear sky.
- **Background Images**: Multiple background images, including mountains, moon, sun, and birds, are layered using CSS.
- **Smooth Animation**: The transition effect between night and day is achieved using the `transition` property, providing a smooth 8-second animation.

---

### Steps to Run:
   
1. **File Structure**:
   The project consists of two main files:
   - `sunrise.html`: The structure of the web page.
   - `sunrise.css`: The styles and animations for the background and hover effect.

2. **Add Images**:
   Ensure that the following image files are present in the project directory:
   - `leftmountainnight.png`
   - `fullmoon.png`
   - `smlmountainnight.png`
   - `sun.png`
   - `birds.gif`
   - `mountainnight.png`
   - `smlmountainrgrightnight.png`
   - `night-space.jpg`
   
3. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open the `sunrise.html` file in a web browser.

4. **Hover Effect**:
   Once the page is loaded, hover over the body of the page to see the sun rise from behind the mountain, and the scene transition from night to day.

### Customizations:

- **Sunrise Timing**: You can adjust the timing of the sun's rise by changing the `transition` value in the `.moun` and `.moun:hover` styles. For example, you can shorten or lengthen the time to make the sunrise faster or slower.
  
- **Images**: To create a different effect, you can replace the current images with your own images that depict a different scene or theme.
  
- **Animation Speed**: Adjust the `transition` property duration (currently set to `8s`) to make the effect faster or slower.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how you can create an engaging visual effect using only HTML and CSS. It uses background images and the `transition` property to simulate a rising sun, enhancing user interaction with the page.

Feel free to modify and extend this project to create more complex animations or add interactive elements!
